# I.D.E. Detection Extension

What does "I.D..E." stand for you say? Well, it's I.D.E. Detection Extension. :wink: 

This is a small extension that detetcts & adds your current IDE's name into the global context. 

It was mainly developed to be used within `when` contexts in your `keybindings.json` file.
